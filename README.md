# CLV Analysis

## ATF

In this homework, I analyzed the telco.csv dataset, to gain insights into parametric models and CLV. After doing statistical analyses, I chose to continue with the random forest model, since it was the most balanced one among them. Also, we get that significant features are tenure, age, income, and address.

## CLV

By choosing an appropriate model, I calculated CLV per customer, and eventually got CLV per Customer: $5383.68 this value. Then, I explored CLV with different segments.

### Report

I worte a brief report based on CLV results. The report includes interpretetion of coefficients, finding the most valuable segment, calculation of annual retention budget(with imaginary numbers) and suggesting action for retention.

All other information, is completely described and visualized in MAHW3.ipynb file.

Thank you!
